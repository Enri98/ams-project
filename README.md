This study investigates the relationship between human values, trust levels, and belief in conspiracy theories across Europe using data from Round 10 of the European Social Survey (ESS). The primary goal is understanding how human values and trust in institutions and individuals influence two conspiracy beliefs: the belief in secret control of world politics and the belief that scientists manipulate evidence. Our analysis employs several multivariate statistical methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering (Gaussian Mixture Models and DBSCAN), MANOVA tables and mixed-effects linear models. PCA identified interpretable components for trust but less clear dimensions for human values, reflecting the complexity of ethical beliefs. Clustering of political profiles did not yield meaningful distinctions in the identified clusters; hence countries were used as grouping variables in the mixed-effects models. The findings indicate that higher institutional trust is associated with lower conspiracy beliefs, while human value orientations show a more complex, possibly non-linear influence. At the country level, MANOVA analysis identified cross-national variability in the conspiracy beliefs, while the mixed-effect modelsâ€™ random effects were not statistically significant.
